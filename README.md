# Linear Regression (Housing Dataset)

### Overview
This project is part of my internship tasks at Elevate Labs.  
It implements **Linear Regression** on the Housing dataset to predict house prices.

### Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored dataset (`Housing.csv`).
- Converted categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
- Split data into **train (80%)** and **test (20%)** sets.
- Trained a **Linear Regression model** using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluated the model with:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
  - R² (Coefficient of Determination)
- Visualized **Actual vs Predicted Prices**.

### Files
- `Task3_LinearRegression.ipynb` → Notebook with code + outputs.  
- `Housing.csv` → Dataset used for training/testing.  
- `README.md` → This report.  

### Results
- Model shows reasonable performance on test data.  
- Higher R² indicates the model explains a good portion of variance in house prices.  
- Scatter plot shows predictions align well with actual prices.
